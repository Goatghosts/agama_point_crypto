Building digital security and privacy is a complex task that requires a combination of technical, legal and organisational measures. Here are some key areas on which digital security and privacy can be built:


Strong encryption: the use of strong and reliable encryption is an essential element to protect data from unauthorised access. It is important to use reliable encryption algorithms and ensure proper implementation and key management.


Managing access rights: Managing access rights and permissions is important to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. This includes the use of strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and proper permission settings at the user, network, and system levels.


Software and hardware security solutions: Using updated and reliable antivirus software, firewalls and other security tools is important to detect and protect against malware, hacker attacks and other threats.


Employee education: educating employees on proper cybersecurity practices is key. Employees should be made aware of the risks associated with phishing, social engineering and other attack techniques. They should be able to identify potentially dangerous situations and know how to respond to them.


Regular data backup and recovery: regular data backup is important to minimise data loss in the event of an attack or technical failure. It is also important to perform data recovery tests to ensure that backups are functional and available when needed.


Compliance with data privacy regulations: compliance with data privacy regulations and laws is essential to protect privacy. This includes, for example, compliance with the GDPR in the European Union or other relevant laws in various countries.


Security auditing and monitoring: Regular security auditing and monitoring of systems and networks is essential to detect potential vulnerabilities and unusual activity. Monitoring should be carried out in real time and include security incident detection and response systems (IDS/IPS).


It is important to recognize that digital security and privacy is an ongoing process that requires constant updating, education, and response to new threats and challenges in cyberspace.
